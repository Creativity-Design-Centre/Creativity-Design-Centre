  Great phone so far! Mind you I’m easily impressed especially because my previous phone was an iPhone 5c so this was a big upgrade for me lol there’s so many new features that I like and having more than enough space feels so good! (My previous phone was 16GB)The only downside is the phones keep getting bigger and my hand is small, but I just got a ring holder case so it helps.


  Product is great, I had it for 10 months, after 6 months the battery efficiency started decaying but nothing major.The point that needs attention is the lack of IMEI number within the receipt at your Amazon order. My phone was stolen and I couldn't prove my purchase.


  Great phone, though it had a 2 business days delivery delay and the apple wall plug charger was missing, that's a negative point since it was in the description.


  I was a little worried when purchasing this phone but was delighted when it arrived. The only reason I’ve given it 4 stars is due to the charging lead supplied doesn’t work but phone is perfect.


  So far so good only had it for a few weeks


  good phone and delivered as stated. all i can afford but not really much better than the 6 i had.


  Works fine, feels more like a downgrade from the iPhone6 as the home button is different and there’s no headphone jack.


  daughter loved it


  Product in great condition


  Didn’t personally work for my sim but still worked well


  No dislikes.  So far working well


  Arrived the item on time. My elder son like the shape and size of it.


  Does everything I need.


  The phone was in pretty good condition, other than a few scuffs on the screen it was immaculate.


  Moving up from a 4s to 7 was like rediscovering why so much fuss is made about iPhones and I saved 100 pounds. Bargain.


  Considering the phone was preowned it is in good working quality, just a few surface scratches but I always use a case anyway.


  Good phone , but some scratches


  Happy with the purchase and delivery


  Very happy with product.


  the phone is just perfect, the only problem is that there it was no box


  Arrived much quicker than expected. Does get quite hot when FaceTiming for a while.


  Its an Iphone so whats to say beyond it works but its bloody expensive. This was a replacement for the wife ( Don't ask) arrived quickly and worked just fine. If only they weren't so overpriced.


  The phone is great however the description does not mention that phone will arrive with only USB cable and no charger. I have contacted the seller and just got response that this is what it is due to their business processes. Which is fair but misleading the customers is not and I pointed to them that they need to change the description of the product so that customer is aware there is no charger included when buying.


  It was a present for my daughter and it was received well before Christmas.


  Few scratches on the back but this phone is definetely good if you are looking for a phone that isn't to expensive but is still up to date.


  Nice


  I’ve had my iphone 7 since early September and here is my review:Positives:- First of all, what sets it apart from other iphones previous to this model is that it is waterproof, meaning that you will no longer be placing your hone in rice when it gets wet, it also means that you get stunning underwater photos- Speaking of stunning photos, the camera on this thing is brilliant, better than other Samsung models that I have used that came out at the same time. This is also great as I no longer have to carry my camera around when I go out on walks and such.- The phones processor is very good and it runs apps smoothly and quickly without much fault, and many of the faults that do occur, are updated in apples software updates- I have the 128gb version of this phone which is a lot more data than I need, meaning that I wont ever run out.Negatives:- One major negative I think that most people have with this phone is that they removed the headphone jack, which means that all headphone plug ins go through the charging port, this means that you can no longer listen to music and charge your phone unless you have a dongle.- Another issue I have with this phone is that it is easily cracked, I recommend that if you buy this product, you also buy a case with it, so you wont end up having to get a new one.


  the iPhone 7 delivers a unique experience among iPhones, which is both a good and bad thing. The new features – water resistance, an incredible quad-core processor and, crucially, a 32GB starting storage capacity – are all very welcome. So is the excellent camera that’s had the right upgrades to make photos look better.So all in all, I would say its a very great phone to have, there are others better, but for the price and year it was made, it is still a great phone


  it is nice and protects the phone. However, the case is too thick and some charging cables do not fit when the case is on so you have to take the case off when charging with some cables that are not from apple


  Arrived 1 day later, but everything is perfect
