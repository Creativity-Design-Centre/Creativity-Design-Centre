  I was initially happy with the phone. However, I have now experienced many difficulties with the battery which for some reason does not last long - e.g. finishes with a 30 mins WhatsApp talk. Additionally, I have experienced continuing dropp of from wifi connection. This happened even if I changed my broadband provider.


  It's a pretty decent phone for £299. Unfortunately, it became faulty after two days use to had to return it as couldn't exchange. Otherwise, I would have been happy with it and given it 4 stars.


  Battery life is very poor


  The phone was delivered fine but it seems like there is some issue with the touch screen ocassionally...sometimes the phone dont respond to a touch. Very rarely though. Not sure if this is a software glitch.


  This phone is meh. I know that’s not really a word but it’s what comes to mind when I think of the iPhone 7. It’s meh. It’s okay. It’s not the worst phone but it’s certainly not the best.  The build of the phone is good. It feels good in the hand and it’s comfy to hold. The phone is a nice decent size although the display wouldn’t hurt to be a bit bigger to shrink the obnoxious beazels. There is one major flaw with this phone though and that is the fact it misses the headphone jack. For some people that might not matter. But for me it matters intensely as a lot of my time spent on my phone is spent listening to music and yes you can listen to music on this phone with Apples supplied headphones but the moment you wanna charge your phone and listen to music you can’t or if you’re watching something on your phone you can charge at the same time. And to me that’s a big deal breaker. Aside from that the build of this phone is magnificent.  The softwear on this phone confuses me. It’s simple to use but it confuses me in the sense that it develops bugs and then fixes them by itself. The phone is almost self healing in that sense but the problem is it’s causing the problems in the first place. And every time apple release a new update there seems to be a massive bug realesed along side.  The camera on this phone is amazing though. It’s simple to use and takes amazing photos. The problem is it’s kind of too simple to use; it lacks a pro mode unlike other phones like Samsung’s. The speakers on this phone are not half bad. But theyre not HTC speakers. But they get the job done and do it reasonably well. Overall this phone is good. But it’s not amazing. If you can afford to I’d recommend splashing out and getting the iPhone 8 as it seems a lot better than this one. Or not I would definitely recommend a Samsung or the iPhone 6 as they both still have a headphone jack.


  Nice product , even though , on the Jet Black..there are issues that for sure will come up in the near feature : as soon as you pick up the phone ,all your fingerprints are on the back , you need to constantly wipe it to bet the Jet Black you'd expect ... I fear , that unless you use a case , the scratches on the back will be more obvious than on other models..time will tell...As for the phone itself..well ,a 256GB can't disappoint i guess...The rest..more or less similar with 6S


  The battery did not meet my expectations. The screen hanged twice so far. My feeling is that the phone is too expensive for what it offers, but it is early to judge 100%


  Are you having a laugh? IPhone 7 for half a grand! Iphone XR is available for 650!


  I regret getting one aince I cant charge and listen to music at the same time!There is no earphone jack and wireless headphones are hassle themselves


  The screen has shattered after only two weeks with a screen protector and case on to protect it. I love it when its not damaged.

  Very unintuitive home button updateLayout of IOS grows on youPerhaps stick to 6 or go iPhone X; better value for money?


  Doesn't work they said it was waterproof but it didn't survive 100L of hydrochloric acid and I went number 1 on it and a runnny number 2And the lack of the headphone jack was very not ungoodThe wireless headphones fit nicely on top of my electric toothbrush


  It holds up pretty well, no noticeable slowdowns in day to day use.  I don't play games on it so i don't know how that works on it. But for Fb, email, browsing, it's ok. It's major downside is the battery life. I can't get a full day with it, the battery drains really fast. Checked the health and it's at 100%.


  Quite happy with this purchase although I've only had it for s couple of months, I find a slight problem when using speaker phone I get complaints that the transmission is poor. Never had complains with my IPhone 5


  Good phone, but you can hardly hear what people are saying even with the sound turned up full. I won't be going out of my way to buy another


  Typical crap battery as on I phones especially when on fb !


  Incredibly similar to the 6S, not worth the upgrade.


  The phone appeared brand new and the price I paid was far less for a phone of this make.  However, the microphone was not functioning.  I am pleased that I got a brand new replacement when reported to Apple store in White City.


  Unlike the previous iphones the screen gets easily scratched in your pocket, the black coating makes the surface very slippery and the lack of the audio jack is simply dumb.Besides that, it's just another iphone, you buy it because you are used to the OS.


  It's make your mind up time...
